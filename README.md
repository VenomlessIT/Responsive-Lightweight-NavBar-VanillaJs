# Responsive-Lightweight-NavBar-VanillaJs
Navigation bar made as a template for future projects
Made with HTML, CSS/CSS3, VanillaJS.
Using one and most valuable tool above all, only my brain, without usage of the Web or learning materials.
Couple of hours of work, approximately 2-4 with breaks.

Lightweight edition of a responsive Navigation Bar made compatible to other users and best practices,
(even tough we used some of the old ones who are still in use today).
